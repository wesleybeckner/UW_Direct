    "What is Potentially Monte Carlo?\n",
    " \n",
    "* Monte Carlo is a simulation technique. Can be used to randomly search through transition strategies\n",
    "   \n",
    "What determines a failed transition? NaN (Not a number)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* if a transistion was aborted shows NaN A grade sheets produced (they did not produce an A grade sheets\n",
    "    \n",
    "Why is there a color and a Next Color code, on top of each other????\n",
    "\n",
    "* the color and next color code shows what they are transitioning from/to (Corian products are destinguished by 'color') in the first row they are going from 1M to CW\n",
    "\n",
    "What is AN1/2 and CCDIM rows?\n",
    "\n",
    "* CCDIM column is short hand for them to specify family/color and thickness (gauge). In essence it is the 'Product' name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do three sheets of columns need to be converted to numeric?\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is so that pandas can perform numerical operations on the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Which three sheets are you referring to?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Total Sheets\tAGrade Sheets\tTransition Sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "Why merge the two data sheets?\n",
    "WHY separate the merge?\n",
    "Why family x y? \n",
    "Why pigment x y? \n",
    "Why subfamily x y?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In these steps I am attaching family/subfamily/pigment information to the transition table for the starting and ending product. the df_desc dataframe is a table that describes each product. I am using it to fill out a full profile for the products in the transition dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do you mean by usual color code only used once? ‘DP’ and ‘dv’\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is just a note referencing that they only transitioned to these products one time\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you mean by operational upsets?\n",
    "What do you mean by giving up a transition? \n",
    "Why did they give up on producing a grade sheet for initial cast order?\n",
    "What do you mean by the next cast order? \n",
    "\n",
    "* whenever they have greater than around 100 failed transition sheets they call this an operational upset -- there is something wrong with the process and they typically stop the transition and reset something in the production line, then go back to trying to make the transition. If they give up on a transition the 'Cast Order' column stays the same but a new 'Next Cast Order' is assigned to the transition. Cast orders / Next cast orders are the SKU or whats put into accounting when they make a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do they have so many attempts which determine transition cost? 1M-CW\n",
    "\n",
    "* this is an example of an operational upset. They're still trying to make the transition, but they stop the process to fix something then start it agian, these appear as separate rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "WN-PG, Why did even though first time they have A grade sheet, but there’s still more cast order\n",
    "\n",
    "* thats a good question. you can see the time gaps, maybe they had to stop the process to fix something else in the line, or stop for some other reason. "
